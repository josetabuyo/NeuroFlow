# About the Author

## José Miguel Tabuyo

Argentine. A programmer since age 12 and a clay modeler — two childhood
passions that carried into adulthood. A constant drive to understand how
things work, with a lasting obsession with the fundamental questions of
the world, led to the question that drives NeuroFlow: **what is the mind?**

Over 20 years of professional experience in software development,
electronic engineering, and artificial intelligence.

### Education

Secondary studies at a high school with a strong focus on computer
science — in contact with programming languages since age 12.

He enrolled at **[Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN)](https://www.utn.edu.ar)**
in Argentina (2000–2006) to study Electronic Engineering.

### GIAR — Grupo de Inteligencia Artificial y Robótica

Very young, in his early twenties, he joined the
**[GIAR](https://giar.ai)** (Grupo de Inteligencia Artificial y
Robótica) at UTN — a research and development laboratory founded in
1986, a pioneer in AI and robotics in Latin America. The group was
originally called **GIA** (Grupo de Inteligencia Artificial) and
expanded its scope to robotics when members dedicated to the mechanical
aspects of robots joined.

At GIAR, José Miguel worked on:

- **Handwritten text recognition**: development of a handwritten
  character recognizer, maintenance of the image database, computation
  of descriptors, and mathematical analysis of the classification
  hyperspace.

- **Hu moments and image descriptors**: in-depth study of the
  descriptors used at the time to distinguish characters, logos, and
  other types of images. Analysis of the material feasibility of
  classification with the available datasets and descriptors.

- **Descriptor ranking**: classification of descriptors from most to
  least relevant for the recognition task.

- **Study of the classification hyperspace**: independent research on
  how classes are organized in high-dimensional spaces — progression
  from hypotheses of spheres, ellipses, ellipsoids, correlated
  ellipsoids, to complex shapes. Two years later, he discovered that
  the existing literature (Fukunaga, Duda & Hart) confirmed his
  intuitive findings.

- **Neural networks**: development of Hopfield, Perceptron, and
  **backpropagation models implemented from scratch** — from academic
  PDFs, without access to modern internet tools or AI agents. In an era
  when software was lost on floppy disks.

- **PET tomograph**: collaboration on a team that developed a PET-ray
  tomograph. Mathematical interpretation (integrals on paper and pencil)
  of the probability density of ray encounters in the detector panels,
  to understand the probabilistic location of bodies and tumors.

- **FPGA**: participation in conversations and debates on hardware
  development with FPGAs.

### Intellectual journey

1. ***The Mind's I*** (Hofstadter & Dennett, 1981) — the gateway to
   philosophy of mind
2. **Richard Dawkins** — evolutionary biology, *The Selfish Gene*, memes
   and memetics
3. **Daniel Dennett** — *Consciousness Explained*, daemons, the Joycean
   machine, the rejection of the Cartesian theater
4. The **evolutionary, iterative, and distributed** view of reality —
   applied to biology as well as economics and neuronal activity
5. Work at **GIAR** — direct contact with deep physics, electronics,
   pattern classification, and neural networks from their foundations

## Dedication

This work is dedicated to **Carlos Javier Lurgo**, a close collaborator,
also Argentine, graduate in Electronic Engineering from UTN (2000–2007)
and member of **GIAR**, where he conducted research in artificial
intelligence and robotics.

### Parallel paths

José Miguel and Javier share an intertwined trajectory spanning more
than two decades:

- **UTN and GIAR** (2000+): they studied together, researched together
  in the Grupo de Inteligencia Artificial y Robótica
- **INDEC** (2004–2008): they coincided as developers at the Instituto
  Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos
- **Plus Sistemas** (2010–2013): they coincided again at the same
  software factory
- **Vortex protocol**: both worked in the Vortex ecosystem — José
  Miguel created VortexJS (implementation of the protocol in
  JavaScript), Javier developed VortexCommander, VortexComm and
  ConsolaVortex
- **Traders**: distributed P2P system for commodity exchange, a shared
  project

Along that path, they participated in countless conversations, joint
work, and parallel development in a shared search for a model of the
mind — the machinery of the self, the machinery we observe in
intelligent animals, far beyond language.

### Javier today

Javier specialized in robotics and cloud systems. His recent trajectory:
